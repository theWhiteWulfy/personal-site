If it wasn't painfully obvious, I use Google. You can follow your top searched items.

If this wasn't any consolation you can defintely get yourself a new account and a browser and just use that to track and search for whatever you want.

I used to search for all development related stuff using one google account and used another account to search for the rest. Well it defintely made a difference. My feed is quite focused and I did get a [foo.bar](https://foobar.withgoogle.com/) invite.
