The answer that no one likes to hear is "*practice, practice, practice.*" I wish there was some magical shortcut for learning how to code, but there isn't.

I learn something new every time I make something or just see something. It helps me make sense of what I lack and what I know. The best way to improve your craft is by putting in the time through observation and experimentation. Observe from others what you wanna do and experiment with those concepts yourself.

Having clients and getting paid was a great motivator for me, and helped me advance my skills from a tender age of 13, but I still have a lot to learn.
