I strongly believe that reading, and educating yourself, is the answer to a better life. And ultimately, freedom. Nelson Mandela said it best:

**“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.”**

I enjoy reading/listening to books and always curious what others are reading. Mostly I enjoy reading from categories such as Science Fiction, Personal Development, Psychology or Technology.From as far back as I can recall, regardless of wherever I was in life or whatever was happening in my world, there were books. Like the people that pass through our personal corner of the planet, most I remember fondly, but only vaguely.

Here is my list of recent compelling reads. I bet you’ll see a few books you love too and maybe a new one (or three) to add to your probably already dangerously high pile. The books that I particularly enjoyed are starred. The list is not in any particular order. I decided to put both the finished books and even those I did not finish: those that I left, those that I lost on the train, those that I consulted, those that “yes, I’ll finish you one day”, those I-would-but-I-will-not-touch-anymore (I always try to read cover to cover). The complete/incomplete binary division simplifies things, just like fiction/nonfiction (the latter assumes a long separate explanation, which I’ll save for a later post): fiction is novels and short stories, nonfiction is everything else. Poetry there is not.

When I speak of read books, therefore, I mean all those I had in my hands and somehow I read; when I specify finished I mean really finished.

Now my personal and professional life revolves around books, and I can’t think without automatically thinking about the books that I've read. It’s simply a matter of identity. Books are bricks: a literal and literary construction of the self, through the words of others. And I would love if you like to suggest something to me, just send me an email or drop a comment below.
