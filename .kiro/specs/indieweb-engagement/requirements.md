2. WHEN I submit a comment THEN the system SHALL validate the input and require captcha verification
3. WHEN my comment is submitted successfully THEN it SHALL be stored in a D1 database table and displayed immediately
4. WHEN I view content with existing comments THEN the system SHALL display all approved comments in chronological order
5. WHEN spam protection is active THEN the system SHALL use a captcha service to prevent automated submissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a website owner, I want comprehensive analytics tracking, so that I can understand user behavior and optimize engagement rates.

1. WHEN a page loads THEN the system SHALL implement DNS prefetch for external resources like fonts and analytics
2. WHEN critical fonts are needed THEN the system SHALL preload them to prevent layout shifts
3. WHEN external resources are loaded THEN the system SHALL use appropriate preconnect hints for performance
4. WHEN resource hints are implemented THEN Core Web Vitals scores SHALL improve or maintain current performance
5. WHEN performance optimizations are active THEN they SHALL not negatively impact existing functionality

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content administrator, I want flexible control over interactive features, so that I can customize engagement options for different types of content.
