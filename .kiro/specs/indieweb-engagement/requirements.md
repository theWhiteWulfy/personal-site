# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements comprehensive IndieWeb standards and protocols for the Meteoric Teachings website. The implementation focuses on microformats2 markup, comment system, IndieWeb discovery links, webmention sending and receiving, Micropub endpoint with draft/update operations, WebSub integration, POSSE cross-posting to X/Twitter, Threads and dev.to, and backfeed aggregation to create a fully IndieWeb-compliant personal website that participates in the decentralized social web.

## Requirements

5. WHEN spam protection is active THEN the system SHALL use captcha, database-backed moderation, and admin tools to prevent abuse

### Requirement 3

5. WHEN endpoints are updated THEN discovery links SHALL automatically reflect the current configuration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to automatically send webmentions when I link to other IndieWeb sites, so that I can notify them of my references and participate in distributed conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I publish content with external links THEN the system SHALL automatically discover webmention endpoints
2. WHEN webmention endpoints are found THEN the system SHALL send webmentions to notify linked sites
3. WHEN webmentions are sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status and retry failed attempts
