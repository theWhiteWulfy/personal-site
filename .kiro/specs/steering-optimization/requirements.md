# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current steering documentation contains significant redundancy across multiple files, making it harder to maintain and potentially confusing for developers. This feature aims to optimize the steering documentation by removing duplicate content, consolidating related information, and creating a more streamlined documentation structure that eliminates redundancy while maintaining all essential information.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the steering documentation, I want non-redundant, well-organized documentation so that I can quickly find relevant information without encountering duplicate content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing steering files THEN the system SHALL identify and eliminate duplicate content across all files
2. WHEN content appears in multiple files THEN the system SHALL consolidate it into the most appropriate single location
3. WHEN similar concepts are covered THEN the system SHALL merge them into unified sections
4. WHEN cross-references are needed THEN the system SHALL use clear references instead of duplicating content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the steering documentation, I want a logical content organization so that I can easily update information in one place without worrying about inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing content THEN each steering file SHALL have a distinct, non-overlapping purpose
2. WHEN technical concepts are documented THEN they SHALL appear in only one authoritative location
3. WHEN file boundaries are established THEN they SHALL follow clear logical separation of concerns
4. WHEN content is moved THEN all related information SHALL be grouped together appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working with the codebase, I want comprehensive coverage of all essential information so that removing redundancy doesn't result in loss of important details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN consolidating content THEN the system SHALL preserve all unique and valuable information
2. WHEN removing duplicates THEN the system SHALL ensure no critical details are lost
3. WHEN merging sections THEN the system SHALL maintain the most complete and accurate version
4. WHEN restructuring THEN the system SHALL verify all use cases are still covered

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using steering files, I want clear file purposes and boundaries so that I know exactly where to look for specific types of information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing steering files THEN each file SHALL have a clear, documented purpose
2. WHEN looking for specific information THEN the file organization SHALL make it obvious which file to check
3. WHEN file names are used THEN they SHALL accurately reflect the content scope
4. WHEN content overlaps conceptually THEN clear boundaries SHALL be established to prevent future duplication
