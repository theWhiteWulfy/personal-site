So, let's begin.

Over the last few days, I have been thinking about how I spent the entire time after the pandemic hit. So basically, my life has seen major upheavals in the pandemic, but I have learned a few lessons that will last with me for a very long time.

One of the few things that I planned but couldn't do consistently was writing. So I needed a way to give myself a chance to share my personal lessons, ideas, and life with others. So I have started recording some conversations with friends or reflecting on my day, day-to-day. There have been several occasions when I am trying to remember some lines in an old conversation, a few things like git repos or maybe some article or an online tool. But I find that I could write them down and stop looking for the same things over and over again. I feel somewhere down the line I can't remember when or how I reached that particular solution. So I feel, in a way, I should be able to record for preserve my thoughts, my learnings, my interests, and hope that I probably in future, could find it of use and maybe someone else does too.

To remedy my situation I have decided that every day, I will dedicate 30 minutes to recording. I'll be putting what I have learned in that particular day, some links of interest, maybe some git repos, maybe a book or two. Plus, I love to listen to music every single day and having a song of the day could be my path to consistency and salvation.
