The Medley is an online journal that I created for a student group. The journal has been quite successful and has given me quite good reads over the years. Their introduction reads as

_**"The Medley is an online literary journal published in India and focused on building a creative space for new and emerging writers, both nationally and internationally. We welcome narratives from writers and poets of all walks of life, work that is acutely personal and emboldened by its universality."**_

## The nitty-gritty

The platform was made on Jekyll. I started off with a readily available theme but ended up making massive changes, so in the end, the functional components were brand new. Since the original method to cheaply host was Github pages, I ended up writing simple automation tasks on grunt and running it on the local machine. I moved it to firebase recently, and now the automation happens on GitHub actions; the published site goes to the pages branch. This shift to firebase was indeed good and has helped me add a few extras.

The logo and the splash screen design were my own concept but derived from their idea, which wasn't that well-formed. They wanted something on lines of holding hands and vines, but I didn't feel it was the way to proceed. In the end, what I have always focused on is simplicity. Which they loved.
