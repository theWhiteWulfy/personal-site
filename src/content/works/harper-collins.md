I was contractually employed by Harper collins to make small custom websites for marketing new books and authors.

I managed the design and development of those websites, end-to-end. The website design was first conceived on paper. After that, a rough web version was made for feedback and improvisation. Our process of designing websites was significantly improved after the launch of Figma in 2016, but it took us time to adapt to Figma's full capabilities.

This particular role slowly became obsolete when WebFlow arrived. Instead of having us(freelance gig workers) craft custom websites, they brought a Webflow plan, edited their templates, and deployed them. Reasonably practical for their organization but not so pleasant for us.
