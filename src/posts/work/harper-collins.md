I was contractually employed by Harper collins to make small custom websites for marketing of new books and authors. I managed the design and development of those websites, end-to-end. the design was first concieved on paper, after that a rough web version was made for feedback and improvisation. This process was significantly improved after launch of figma in 2016, but it took us time to adapt to figma's full capabilites. This particular role slowly became obsolete when WebFlow arrived. Instead of having us(freelance gig workers) craft custom websites, they brought a webflow plan and edited their templates and deployed them. Quite effective for their organisation but not sp pleasant for us.
