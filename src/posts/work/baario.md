Baario is an ever-growing knowledge base of local information sourced and verified by local community members. Whether it's about solving a local issue, finding local help, or sharing something cool with the community, Baario has got it covered. It's a free and open platform where anyone can participate and contribute.

This platform was acquired by Google neighbourly in late 2017, and the links may now be defunct.
