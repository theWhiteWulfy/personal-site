                For the past one year I've been accumulating my knowledge in the
                field of Software-as-a-Service and got several leads. This is my
                attempt to attempt to put that knowledge into one single place
                and organize facts, information, my thoughts, and opinions at
                one single place.
            </p>
            <p>
                My plan was to complete a post a day, but the challenge is
                eating way too much time. Instead Iâ€™m going to keep things as
                they are happen happen as they happen.
            </p>

            <ul>
                {
                    data.map((node) => (
                        <li id={node.id}>
                            <Link to={`/${node.collection}/${node.slug}`}>
                                {node.data.title}
                            </Link>
                        </li>
                    ))
                }
            </ul>
        </div>
    </main>
