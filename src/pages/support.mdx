The articles I publish have been a true labor of love for me. If you've found any of this content useful here's how to show your thanks and motivate me to create more.

## Spread the word

Have a website or use social networking sites like Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+, Tumblr, or Pinterest? Please consider sharing the content found on **Metoric Teachings** or linking to [https://alokprateek.in](https://alokprateek.in).

## Follow me on social media

I post infrequently on social media --- I'm not the type to barf out a stream of rants and retweets in quick succession. Posts are typically life lessons, web design and development tidbits, sarcastic remarks, and photographic fragments from whatever little life I live.

If these sorts of things interest you, follow along on:
