                <strong>Who it's for:</strong> For businesses struggling with
                manual data entry, disconnected applications, and workflows that
                can't keep up with their growth.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>What you deliver:</strong> I will design, build, and manage
                robust automation systems for you. Using tools like n8n, custom
                APIs, and secure, private AI models, I connect your existing
                software to eliminate bottlenecks. I have experience taking products
                from concept to platforms serving over 100,000 users and can build
                solutions that scale.

                the functionality of expensive SaaS products without the vendor

                <strong>What you deliver:</strong> I deploy, customize, and manage
                powerful open-source tools for analytics, project management,
                scheduling, and more. You get a solution branded for your business,
                running on secure cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) that I
                manage for you. My experience includes migrating entire frontends to
                modern frameworks and creating documentation systems from the ground
                up.
