            Have a question for me? My direct messages are open on either{' '}
            <a href="https://instagram.com/thewhitewulfy">Instagram</a> or{' '}
            <a href="https://twitter.com/thewhitewulfy">Twitter</a> for short and
            succinct messages. Before sending, please read my{' '}
            <Link to="/faqs/">frequently asked questions section</Link> first to
            make sure I haven't already answered it.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a project that you'd like to discuss, it is faster and
            more efficient to contact me <a href="https://wa.me/919315852108">on Whatsapp</a> or write a mail
            to me at <a href="mailto:i@alokprateek.in">i@alokprateek.in</a>. A
            good ol' fashioned mail is always welcome, because I like reading and
            writing long mails as I do not have much time for writing shorter
            replies.
          </p>
