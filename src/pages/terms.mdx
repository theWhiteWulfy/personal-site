## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyze how users use the site.

Like many other web sites owners, I use Google Analytics on this site.

### What does Google Analytics record?

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. In case of activation of the IP anonymization, Google will truncate/anonymize the last octet of the IP address for Member States of the European Union as well as for other parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases, the full IP address is sent to and shortened by Google servers in the USA. On behalf of the website provider Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website provider. Google will not associate your IP address with any other data held by Google.

I use Google Analytics to collect non-personal data to answer questions such as:

- What kind of browser & operating system you visited the site on?
- How long you stay on the site?
- What pages on the site you visit?
- What area of the world you are located in?
- How is this data is used?

The data gathered allow me to better understand the visitors to this site and how it is viewed, this allows me to make better decisions about the site and any future additions to it.

Occasionally I compile aggregate statistics on various usage and/or user metrics for the site. No personally identifying data is included in this type of reporting.

None of the data gathered through Google Analytics is shared with any 3rd party.

All of my activity falls within the bounds of the Google Analytics Terms of Service.

### How to opt out of tracking

You can opt out of the tracking conducted by Google Analytics by using the browser plugin provided by Google that prevents your data from being used by Google Analytics.

You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. However, please note that if you do this, you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. Furthermore you can prevent Google’s collection and use of data (cookies and IP address) by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).
