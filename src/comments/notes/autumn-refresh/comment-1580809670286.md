I'd be interested to read about images production strategy you used with Jekyll or Gatsby. I read all your Jekyll related posts, but still missing the full picture and there is a lot of questions about workflow still.

1. Why separate repos for original (feature) imgs and generated imgs? Why it is git submodule?
2. Where you run gulp jobs to generate images? Locally?
3. Is lazyload still a thing or not?
4. What is step by step build→test→deploy workflow you are ok with?

I'm using Gitlab CI/CD to build my Jekyll site with 2 evironments and pretty happy with it. But I'm quite sure it'll became pain in the ass with responsive images generation, so I'm trying to find flexible workflow to improve pages size and loading speed. Maybe, you can point me to proper comment, post or even tut?
